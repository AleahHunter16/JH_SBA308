SO I did change the dates and the ID's and and grades because I thought thats what we were suppose to do but at this point I just left them and saw it through 
//* I did look up what a parse float was and I used ws3chools and MDN for parsefloat 
and I also used another website to see the console log because I was struggling to see it on VS code I used JavaPlayground for that *//
